Create a position class and define the constructor.

**Description**:
This code defines a console-based game named "Gem Hunters," where two players move on a 6x6 board to collect gems. The game's primary goal is to collect more gems than the opponent within a set number of turns. Here's a breakdown of the code and how the game operates without involving any Components.

**Program Class**:
Contains the application's entry point (Main method) where an instance of the Game class is created and started.

**Position Class**: 
Represents the (X, Y) coordinates on the board for players and possibly other entities in future expansions.

**Player Class**:
Represents a player in the game, holding information like the player's name, position on the board, and the count of collected gems. It also includes a method to move the player in one of four directions (U, D, L, R) based on input.

**Cell Class**:
Represents a cell on the game board. Each cell can hold an occupant represented as a string, indicating whether it's a space, a gem, an obstacle, or a player.
